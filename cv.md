## Profile
After getting my bachelor's degree, I moved to the United States from Russia and literally started life from scratch. This move gave me both many opportunities and many questions about which area I would like to develop. Having tried myself in the field of photography and as a stock illustrator, I realized that I would like to leave these areas as a hobby, and develop professionally in a different way. About twelve years ago I was dabbled a bit of HTML and CSS, but I didnâ€™t delve deeply (intuitively I reworked Tumblr templates for myself, for example), now I understand that this experience was interesting for me, but now (after all this years) I would like to know and be able to do much more. Therefore I was interested in front-end development and realized that I would like to grow professionally in this area.
